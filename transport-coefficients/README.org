#+title: Transport coefficients for gases

* Introduction

  This package implements code for calculating transport coefficients
  of gases and gas mixtures.

  Some of the expressions are based on the Chapman-Enskog solution
  while others (implemented but still to be included into the package)
  are numerical fits to experimental data

  The code will eventually provide means of selecting which method is
  used.

  Most of the inputs to the code are in SI units and the code returns
  quantities in SI units.


* User interface conventions
  The functions that calculate viscosity, thermal conductivity,
  diffusion, accept arguments in the following order:
  - model (if needed)
  - species or collision parameters (objects of type molecular potential)
  - density specification (densities, concentrations, or pressures)
  - temperature
  - others.
